# WindowsFormsApp-MathsGame

## Description:
This project is a game which is meant to help people learn the multiplication tables.
In this game the user creates an account and logs in. The user studies the tables and undergoes math tests. They can also see statistics based on their results so they know if they did well or not. Apart from that, the tests adapt to the user's needs, meaning that they are tested more in the multiplication table they have the most trouble with.
